# VAC-Bypass-Injector
Injector which bypasses new VAC anti-injection.
This injector DOES NOT bypass the VAC anticheat itself YET, so you will have to use an undetected cheat along with this injector.
This injector only bypasses the techniques Valve uses to detect thread creation and LoadLibrary injection.

Credits to danielkrupinski for pseudocode of VAC modules.

USAGE: Place DLL to inject in same directory as injector. Run injector, and it will automatically inject the first DLL it finds in the same folder.
